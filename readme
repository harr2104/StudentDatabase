# React Native Project Setup

This guide provides the steps to set up and run a basic React Native project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher): [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Watchman** (for macOS): `brew install watchman`
- **React Native CLI**: Install it globally with:
  ```bash
  npm install -g react-native-cli
  ```
- **Xcode** (for iOS development on macOS):
  - Install Xcode from the App Store.
  - Install Xcode Command Line Tools:
    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```
  - Open Xcode and ensure you have the latest iOS SDK.

- **Android Studio** (for Android development):
  - [Download and install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
  - During installation, ensure to include Android SDK, Android SDK Platform, and Android Virtual Device.
  - Set up environment variables:
    ```bash
    export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
    ```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **For iOS (on macOS):**

    - Install CocoaPods dependencies:
      ```bash
      cd ios && pod install && cd ..
      ```
    - Run the iOS project:
      ```bash
      npx react-native run-ios
      ```

4. **For Android:**

    - Ensure Android emulator is running or connect a physical device.
    - Run the Android project:
      ```bash
      npx react-native run-android
      ```

## Running the App

To run the project in development mode:

- Start Metro bundler:
  ```bash
  npx react-native start
  ```
- Run the app on iOS or Android using the commands mentioned above.

## Building the App

### iOS:

1. Open the `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.
2. Set up the signing & capabilities for your Apple Developer account.
3. Build the app for production.

### Android:

1. In `android/app/build.gradle`, set up your `release` signing config.
2. Build the app for production:
   ```bash
   cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```

## Debugging

### React Native Debugger

You can use Chrome DevTools or any other debugger such as React Native Debugger to debug the app.

- To open the in-app developer menu:
  - Shake the device or press `Cmd + D` on iOS or `Cmd + M` on Android emulator.
  
## Troubleshooting

1. **Metro Bundler Issues**: Try resetting the cache:
   ```bash
   npx react-native start --reset-cache
   ```

2. **Build Errors**: Ensure Xcode or Android Studio is up-to-date and the appropriate SDK versions are installed.

3. **Dependency Issues**: Run `npm audit fix` or reinstall the `node_modules`:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules && npm install
   ```
